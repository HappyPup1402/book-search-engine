## Description

The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can sign up, log in, and save their favorite books to their personal account. The app is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server for handling API queries. It offers a seamless user experience where users can search for books, save their selections, and view their saved books in their personal library.
